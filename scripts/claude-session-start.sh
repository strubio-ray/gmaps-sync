# scripts/claude-session-start.sh — SessionStart hook for Claude Code.
#
# Wired into .claude/settings.json (matcher "startup|resume"), so it runs AFTER
# Claude Code launches, on every session, in BOTH local and Claude Code on the
# web (cloud) environments. Follows the org contract proven by gha-outrunner,
# vibe-kanban, and karakeep: a thin cloud "Setup script" (scripts/cloud-setup.sh)
# warms the env-cache by running this hook's installs once; every later session
# re-runs this hook as a fast, idempotent no-op.
#
#   https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#setup-scripts-vs-sessionstart-hooks
#   https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#sessionstart
#
# Contract (rubio-standards §6.1 — enforced by check.sh on CONTENT):
#   1. Abort-proof: every network/install/toolchain step is `|| true`, and the
#      script ALWAYS ends in `exit 0`. A SessionStart hook must never abort the
#      session. `set -euo pipefail` is kept for shellcheck/convention parity, so
#      every fallible step below is explicitly guarded.
#   2. Bridge GH_TOKEN -> GITHUB_TOKEN (mise's aqua backend resolves release
#      metadata via api.github.com and 403s on the unauthenticated rate limit).
#   3. Persist PATH via $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE — the only mechanism that exposes tools
#      to a session's later Bash calls (in-process exports do not carry).
#   4. Resolve the repo root from THIS script's location (BASH_SOURCE), NOT from
#      CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, which in multi-repo workspaces may point at a parent
#      directory. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is used only as a non-authoritative sanity
#      cross-check (a warning on mismatch).
#   5. Emit a cloud-setup drift NOTE on stdout when scripts/cloud-setup.sh and
#      its snapshot-persisted fingerprint disagree (silent no-op locally).
#   6. Emit ONE concise line on stdout (a SessionStart hook's stdout becomes
#      Claude's context); all install chatter goes to stderr.
#   7. Idempotent: check-if-present before reinstalling.
#   8. Optional repo bootstrap: after the warmup, run a repo-owned
#      scripts/session-bootstrap.sh (if present + executable) for startup this
#      template cannot know about — extra toolchains, workspace installs, a dev
#      daemon, env defaults. NOT rendered by the template; abort-proof so it can
#      never fail the session. Absent the file the hook is unchanged, so every
#      rendered hook is the same pure template render.

# abort-proof (`|| true`) so a bootstrap hiccup can never fail the session.

# renders the identical hook. The child runs with: cwd = repo root; the pinned
# toolchain on PATH; $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE available to persist its own env/PATH;
# $GITHUB_TOKEN bridged; $CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE set in cloud. Contract: keep stdout
# clean (this hook's stdout is Claude's context — chatter to stderr) and end in

# (5) Cloud env-cache drift check. scripts/cloud-setup.sh bakes a fingerprint

# no longer matches, the snapshot is stale — cloud-setup.sh was edited but
# CACHE_EPOCH in the UI wrapper was not bumped to force a rebuild. Surface that
# as the one stdout NOTE so it reaches Claude as actionable context. Local
# sessions have no marker (the setup script is cloud-only), so this no-ops.
#
# CACHE-KEY CONVENTION (coherence-critical — keep in lockstep with
# scripts/cloud-setup.sh): the marker is keyed on the RUNTIME checked-out
# directory name, $(basename "$repo_root"), NOT the copier project_name answer.
# cloud-setup.sh WRITES the fingerprint to this exact same path, so the path
# this hook READS and the path that script WRITES are byte-identical regardless
# of whether project_name matches the checkout-dir name. Keying this side on the
# project_name answer would silently break the NOTE whenever a consumer clones
# into a directory whose name differs from project_name.
