# cloud "Setup script" (web UI) field. Paste ONLY the thin wrapper between the
# two "8<" COPY markers below: it stays version-controlled and PR-reviewed here
# instead of pasted-and-forgotten, and it LOCATES this script at runtime rather
# than assuming a path (the cloud Setup script's working directory is NOT the
# repo root, so a bare `bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh` fails with exit 127). The
# block below is an inert heredoc — read and discarded by `:`, never executed —
# so the wrapper is raw, ready-to-paste text: NO comment-stripping needed, just
# copy everything between the two marker lines.

# Forcing a rebuild on demand: the snapshot is rebuilt ONLY when the UI
# Setup-script TEXT changes, when the environment's ALLOWED NETWORK HOSTS
# change, or at the ~7-day expiry — it CANNOT see edits to THIS file, and
# env-var changes do NOT count. So after editing this script, bump CACHE_EPOCH
# in the UI wrapper and re-save. The SessionStart hook
# (scripts/claude-session-start.sh) re-hashes the checked-out script against a
# fingerprint baked into the snapshot (written at the bottom of this file to
# ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/$(basename "$repo_root")/cloud-setup.built —
# see the drift-fingerprint note there) and surfaces a NOTE when a bump is due.
# The hook reads that SAME runtime-basename path, so the two agree byte-for-byte.
# https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#environment-caching
#
# Execution model (cloud only): runs as root on Ubuntu, BEFORE Claude Code
# launches, and ONLY when no cached environment snapshot exists. Its filesystem
# output is snapshotted and reused, so everything here is paid once per cache
# build (~7 days), not per session. Keep total runtime under ~5 minutes so the
# cache can build; independent work runs in parallel below.
#
# Division of labour:
#   * Only root/apt installs, the private-marketplace git credential helper,
#     and snapshot-cacheable warming live here.
#   * Everything portable (the pinned mise toolchain) lives in
#     scripts/claude-session-start.sh so it runs in BOTH local and cloud
#     sessions. This script just calls that hook so the toolchain lands in the
#     snapshot; the per-session SessionStart hook then fast-paths to a no-op.
#
# PRIVATE marketplace auth (REQUIRED only for PRIVATE org plugin bundles):
#   Public org marketplaces (rubio-standards@rubio, claude-lsps) install in
#   cloud with NO token. PRIVATE in-org bundle marketplaces declared in
#   .claude/settings.json need a GH_PAT — a fine-grained PAT (Rubio-Enterprises,
#   Contents:Read on the private marketplace repos) set in each environment's
#   "Environment variables" UI field. ONE shared, narrowly-scoped, read-only
#   token reused across ALL cloud environments is sufficient: "per environment"
#   means the GH_PAT var must be PRESENT in each environment's settings, NOT that
#   each environment needs a DISTINCT token. The per-marketplace-repo credential
#   helper registered below (after the apt step, once jq is available) reads it
#   at CLONE time and is scoped so the read-only token only ever authenticates
#   the marketplace clones, never the working repo. The cloud GitHub token is
#   injected at SESSION start, NOT at setup time, so the helper must be a RUNTIME
#   helper (it cannot embed a token that is not present yet). GH_PAT is a
#   distinct name so it takes precedence over the auto-injected,
#   working-repo-scoped GH_TOKEN for those marketplace repos.

# ONLY, so Claude Code's native marketplace clone (at SESSION start — the token
# is injected then, not now) authenticates with the read-only GH_PAT while the
# WORKING repo keeps using its own session-injected token. The repos are derived
# from the committed carrier's extraKnownMarketplaces (github sources); BOTH the
# bare and ".git" clone-URL forms are registered because git credential
# URL-matching is exact, not suffix-tolerant. Scoping is per-REPO — never a
# global helper, never a github.com/<org> prefix (an org prefix over-matches
# EVERY repo in the org, including the working repo, and would hand it the
# read-only token, breaking working-repo writes). Net effect: ONE shared,
# narrowly-scoped, read-only GH_PAT can never interfere with working-repo auth.
# Token precedence GH_PAT -> GH_TOKEN -> GITHUB_TOKEN, resolved at CLONE time.
# Do NOT use `gh auth setup-git` (errors "not logged into any GitHub hosts").
# Degrades to a single global helper if jq is unavailable or the carrier
# declares no github marketplaces, so a private clone never silently loses auth.

# --- Drift fingerprint for the SessionStart hook ----------------------------
# Snapshot-persisted sha256 of THIS script + the epoch it built under. The

# (cloud-setup.sh edited but CACHE_EPOCH not bumped -> stale snapshot). The
# platform can't detect this: the cache keys off the UI wrapper text. Non-fatal.
#
# CACHE-KEY CONVENTION (coherence-critical — do NOT change to {{ project_name }}):
# the marker is keyed on the RUNTIME checked-out directory name,
# $(basename "$repo_root"), NOT the copier `project_name` answer. The rendered
# SessionStart hook (scripts/claude-session-start.sh, from S-1) derives its
# drift-NOTE path the SAME way — $(basename "$repo_root") — so the path this
# script WRITES and the path the hook READS are byte-identical regardless of
# whether project_name happens to match the checkout-dir name. Keying either
# side on {{ project_name }} would silently break the NOTE whenever a consumer
# clones into a directory whose name differs from project_name. (The standards
# repo's own hand-fixed hook, S-11, hardcodes the `standards` segment instead;
# that is an accepted divergence only because the standards repo basename IS
# `standards` and it has no copier project_name.)
